# MapRushSystems
I’m unable to share all the code, so I’ll be sharing specific systems instead.

This game offers a fun and educational puzzle experience designed for children.
The game consists of rotatable hex (hexagon) tiles. In each level, the goal is to rotate the tiles correctly to create a path from the starting point to the exit.
As players experiment and learn through trial and error, they develop logical thinking, problem-solving, and spatial awareness skills.
The game also features a joker system that helps players when they get stuck.
Jokers provide hints or grant advantages on certain tiles, creating a more supportive and motivating experience without causing frustration.
With simple controls, a clean visual style, and a gradually increasing difficulty level, the game aims to make learning both fun and engaging.
